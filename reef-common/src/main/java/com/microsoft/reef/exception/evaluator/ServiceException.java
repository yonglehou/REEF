/**
 * The base class for exceptions thrown by REEF libraries and services.
 * 
 * Rules of thumb for exception handling in REEF:
 * <ul>
 * <li>When possible, throw a subclass of ServiceException, with the following exceptions (no pun intended)</li>
 * <li>Iterator and other standard Java interfaces neglect to declare throws
 *     clauses. Use ServiceRuntimeException when implementing such interfaces.</li>
 * <li>If there is no good way for Task code to recover from the exception, throw
 *     (and document) a subclass of ServiceRuntimeException</li>
 * <li>Applications with generic, catch-all error handling should catch ServiceRuntimeException and ServiceException.</li>
 * <li>Applications with specific error handling logic (eg: ignoring/coping with a failed remote task) should catch
 *     the subclass of ServiceRuntimeException / ServiceException thrown by the library they are using.</li>
 * </ul>
